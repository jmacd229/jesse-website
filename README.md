  Hi there, welcome to the GitHub repo for my portfolio site!</h1>
<p>There's not much to see here yet as I'm still in the process of building out my site.
I've created this site using Gatsby. It's not only my first time working with Gatsby, but also my first time working with React. Everything I've done is self-taught through various tutorials and articles across the web.

On a typical work day I work on our stack of Java and Angular, so this has been a new challenge, but easy to pick up and get started quickly. I'm hoping to be able to move beyond the "Under construction" section shortly as I get faster at developing in this new framework. I wanted to get the site deployed before fully finished so that I could test out my ability to push out a production build on my own.

This was my first time developing a site from scratch without the help of a team. There are definitely places I could improve, or things I might have missed. Please if you see anything and have a comment or question, head over to my <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-macdougall-6709b7114' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>LinkedIn Profile</a> and shoot me a message.

## Thank-you for your interest!
