  Hi there, welcome to the GitHub repo for my portfolio site!</h1>
<p>There's not much to see here yet as I'm still in the process of building out my site.
I created this website from scratch, initially working in React with no prior experience. 
I self-taught myself in order to get started, and have since started working in React professionally so have had opportunities to incorporate my learnings to make a much cleaner overall site.

Work still continues on the site, but ever so slowly as I have other projects on the go.

Please if you have any comments or questions about the site, please visit my <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-macdougall-6709b7114' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>LinkedIn Profile</a> and shoot me a message.

</p>

## Thank-you for your interest!
